      <img src="images/IMG_8859.JPG" alt="Picture of Anna Clarke with pet dog.">
      <p>Coming from a creative writing and artistic background, I took a sharp left turn into computer programming in the beginning of 2021. I strive to mix the logic and structure of programming with my creative background to create unique, inventive solutions. Currently attending the programming school, <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, I will graduate from a training program in C# and React in February 2022.</p>
      <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy writing speculative fiction, illustration, hiking and crochet.</p>
